# Indroduction to Python

*by Ruben Farinelli*

Solutions of some equations of Physics are often obtain by using FFT. The Pyhton Scipy package provides a powerful suite of routines for this purpose. I will show as an example an application of FFT to solve the 2D Poisson equation to derive the gravitational potential for a given distribution of masses. It is also shown the way to plot the obtained results as well as a the vector field representing the direction of the gravitational force.
